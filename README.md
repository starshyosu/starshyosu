### Welcome to my profile, or probably, Portofolio👋

Long story short, I first created this GitHub account to create a Music Bot on Discord, back on 15.03.2018, but it was failed, and i'll make this GitHub page as my Portofolio sometime in the future.

- 👤 I'm not a coder.
- 🌐 Stay connected with me: Visit my linktr.ee at the link of my page.
- 🌱 Motto? Even though i felt like i'm failed, i realized that i'm learning everyday.

Portofolio :
Staff — Kakumei no Toki : Was once a staff member at an event organizer called Karasu Invasion (now Murasame Society).

      - (please talk to me in Bahasa, my english is kinda bad.)

Thanks for checking by ;)

### hey welcome to my profile 👋

I first created this GitHub account to create a Music Bot on Discord, back on 15.03.2018, but it was failed, and i'll make this GitHub page as my Portofolio sometime in the future.

- 👤 I'm not a coder.
- 🌐 Stay connected with me: Visit my linktr.ee at the link of my page.
- 🌱 Motto? Even though i felt like i'm failed, i realized that i'm learning everyday.


      - (please talk to me in Bahasa, my english is kinda bad.)

Thanks for checking by ;)
